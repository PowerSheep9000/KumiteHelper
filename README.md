# KumiteHelper
KumiteHelper is a small project which lets one create a management system for a (martial arts) tournament.

The core functionalities are:   <ul>
                                    * create contestants (done)
                                    * create weight classes (done)
                                    * add contestants to according weight classes
                                    * create fights between randomized contestants in the same weight class
                                </ul>

So far it is not yet decided, how persistency will be managed (database or maybe local files) and additional functionality may be added.
